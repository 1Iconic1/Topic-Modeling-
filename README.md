# Topic-Modeling-

This paper introduces a methodology that combines topic modeling and word similarity techniques to address two critical challenges in research analysis: paper recommendation systems and gap analysis. The inspiration for this approach stems from the recognition of the inherent difficulty in detecting scientific innovation and accurately attributing it to specific research contributions as well as from a desire to seek novel areas in research. Jordan Boyd-Graber et al.'s insights underscore the complexity of this task, emphasizing that even domain experts often struggle to evaluate the validity and novelty of research findings.
